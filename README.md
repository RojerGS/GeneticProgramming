# Genetic Programming

Genetic Programming algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms that combine some notions of Darwinian evolution with random search.

The implementation found in this repository is largely based on [A Field Guide to Genetic Programming][poli] (2008), by Poli, Riccardo & Langdon, William & Mcphee, Nicholas.
